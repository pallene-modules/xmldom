# xmldom

This is currently a wrapper around SLAXML to provide a faster, more memory efficient DOM which can use simple selectors to make the processing of large XML documents (eg the NIST National Vulnerability Database) possible without running out of memory. It may in the future replace SLAXML with Expat. It requires [halimede](https://github.com/pallene/halimede). Documentation is intentionally not provided at this time as the API is extremely unstable.
